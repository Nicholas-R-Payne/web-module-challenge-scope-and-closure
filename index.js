/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
    In counter1, the variable count is declared in the function scope.
    In counter2, the variable count is declared in the global scope.
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
    The counter1 code uses a closure because it gives access to an outer function's scope from an inner function's scope.
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
    The counter1 code would be preferable when we just need to use the count variable for just the counterMaker function.
    The counter2 code would be preferable when we need to use the count variable outside the counter2 function.
*/

// counter1 code
function counterMaker() {
  let count = 0;
  return function counter() {
   return count++;

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 2: inning() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below
*/

function inning(){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(3));
}


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 3: finalScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}
*/

    Away: awayTotal
  }

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 4: getInningScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

  return{
    Home: inning(),
    Away: inning()

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 5: scoreboard() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 3: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 4: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 0 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 2 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "This game will require extra innings: Away 10 - Home 10"
